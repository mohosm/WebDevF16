	<p>Su Young Lee has had quite the life. She still hasn’t graduated from college, but already lived in three countries, seen half of the world, and also travelled a lot. She is still relatively new to the United States, but plans her life here for the long run.
</p><br/>
	<p>Q: Does your name have a meaning or story behind it?</p>
	<p>A: My full name is Su Young Lee, and it does, because every Korean name has Chinese characters assigned to it, and those usually have a comprehensive meaning. The ones that make up my name mean name “maintain your honor”. It is a unisex name, and I was going to be named this whether I was going to be a boy or a girl. They didn’t want to tell it to my mother before time, because in Korea, much like in a lot of Asian countries, people don’t really want girls.</p>
	<p>Q: How long were you living in Korea?</p>
	<p>A: I lived in Korea for the first seven years of my life, then I moved to New Zealand, where I lived till I was eighteen. I moved to the States after I graduated from high school and now I am here on a student visa, that I want to extend after college.
</p>
	<p>Q: Can you say that any of these places was your favorite?</p>
	<p>A: Experience-wise, I would say my favorite place was New Zealand, but I wouldn’t want to live there again. I don’t feel like these places were culturally very different, because nowadays every place is americanized to some extent. It might be just a New York thing, but I find that people are less friendly here than they are elsewhere. Nevertheless, I plan to stay for a long time after I have graduated, perhaps forever.</p>
	<p>Q: Are you looking forward to vote in this country?</p>
	<p>A: I wouldn’t say I am. I have never voted in my entire life, and it’s not something I’m enthusiastic to do. I would say that politically I am left-leaning, but really, my stance will depend on the candidates.</p>
	<p>Q: What do you think about the current candidates? How does this election compare to the ones you lived through?</p>
	<p>A: I have no previous knowledge of American politics, so I find it quite interesting. I wouldn’t know whether it’s a crazy election compared to the last ones, but I see that it is crazy on its own terms. I don’t think though that this craziness is strange. People went crazy over the elections in Korea. I remember when they elected their first female president, there was a lot of controversy. I feel that is exactly what is happening now here in the States. US politics is only special because the amount of media coverage it receives. It entertains more people.</p>
